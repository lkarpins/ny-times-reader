## Project Overview
This is a take-home challenge for Mod 4 at Turing School of Software & Design. The rubric can be found [here.](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe)

NYTimes Reader is an application that allows a user to browse the current top stories from the New York Times pulication. The dropdown menu allows users to choose a particular section and find top headlines. A user can click on a headline to route to an overview page that provides an image, summary, and link to the full publication.
